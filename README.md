<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Velvet is an AI-powered stock trading & asset management application simplifying UX & bringing hedge-fund investing strategies to the people.
Currently in development.

### This project aims to solve two problems, the first:

The average investor is given two choices.

- Invest with a hedgefund (or similar organization) and give up granular control of your portfolio to the "finance guys".

- Invest in a self trading platform such as Robinhood, ETrade, Etc. and give up the financial experties and infrastructure that a hedgefund uses to generate alpha (HFT, FInanical Strategies, AI Modeling, Etc.)

### The second

Investors are people too – and nobody likes having a hundred finance apps on their phone just to see their personal finance health.

- People need instant insight and analysis capabilities to be able to make personal finance decisions quickly and efficiently.

- Customers should feel like they know everything about their personal finances in minutes - not wonder if they have enough money across their accounts to pay the credit bill this month.

### Our Goal

Provide users with the ability to easily monitor & analyze their personal finance while also being able to leverage quant and ai trading strategies to grow their investment portfolio.
